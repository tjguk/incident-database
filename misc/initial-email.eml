Dear Tim,=0A=
=0A=
Yes it was me that rang, thanks for ringing back. =0A=
=0A=
We need to record all incidents in the school with regard to bullying, raci=
st incidents, disruptive behaviour etc. Ideally we'd be able to populate va=
rious fields to do with the incident through a web page front end - date, t=
ype, description, action, open/closed, follow up needed etc. We need to be =
able to upload attach PDF documents to attach to each incident. Ideally we =
would be able to attach multiple pupils to incidents rather than have to re=
duce duplication. The ability to go back into the record and amend the inci=
dent after its creation would be needed too. =0A=
=0A=
That would be our statutory responsibility but we would like to be able to =
export incidents for individual pupils, year groups and all incidents betwe=
en certain dates. Also to be able to export all the open, closed, follow up=
 needed, incomplete incidents etc would be ideal.=0A=
=0A=
This would enable us to use the data that is collect usefully rather than j=
ust pile the paper up in the corner of a room in case an inspector comes.=
=0A=
=0A=
There are about 175 pupils in school this coming year and looking to the fu=
ture I can't see us ever being over 400 pupils any time soon.=0A=
=0A=
Do you think that this is possible and not too time consuming for someone t=
o undertake?=0A=
=0A=
I hope the annual course is going well - I think Chris Doran is up there wi=
th you - say hi from me.=0A=
=0A=
Best wishes,=0A=
=0A=

Hello Stephen,=0A=
=0A=
Obviously you were behind the missed call I had from the Cedars earlier=0A=
today. I rang back, but the receptionist didn't know who'd called.=0A=
=0A=
Happy to help if I can. Can you give me some idea about the requirements=0A=
-- both the statutory ones and what the school would like -- so I know=0A=
what to advise? I'm up in Thornycroft at the moment (in Cheshire) so not=0A=
easy to meet in person, but feel free to email and/or we can try=0A=
Skype/Hangouts etc.=0A=
